    <div class="line"></div>
    <p>Music is more than the meditation and yoga as it benefits a lot to both body and mind. We can listen music anytime all through the day. It is very good habit to listen music. I generally used to of listening music during my study time and especially during my exams. Learning a musical instrument not only sustains and feeds the brain, but it also improves so many other cognitive and physical aspects of the human body. It's been widely studied and proven that learning a musical instrument improves memory; it not only improves your cognitive memory but also muscle memory as well.</p>
